Generate a word list for a word search puzzle.

Topic: "{{category}}"

Generate exactly {{wordsPerPuzzle}} words related to this topic.

Rules:
- Only output a single line of {{wordsPerPuzzle}} unique, singular words, separated by commas, no spaces.
- Each word or phrase must be clearly related to the topic.
- Only use letters from the English alphabet (a-z).
- For regular words: use all lowercase (e.g., cat, elephant).
- For proper nouns (names, places): capitalize first letter of each word, rest lowercase (e.g., Leonardo da Vinci, New York).
- Keep multi-word proper nouns together as one entry (do not split names or places into separate words).
- Never use ALL CAPS words.
- Keep words simple enough for a word search puzzle.
- No word should appear more than once in the list.
- Only output the word list, nothing else.
- Don't use any complex words
- Don't use any word longer than 15 characters
- Do not ever generate words with spaces
- Do not be creative with the words; each word should seem very obviously be connected to the category for a majority of people.
- Don't use acronyms
- Make sure that all words generated are the same category (ie: don't generate the words "football" and "broncos"; instead, generate "broncos" and "chargers")

Example output format for 4 words:
